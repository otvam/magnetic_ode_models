# Soft Magnetic Materials Models with ODEs

## Summary

This repository contains the **slides** and **code** related to the following **webinar**:
* **Soft Magnetic Materials and Ordinary Differential Equations**
* **From Linear Circuits to Neural Network Models**
* **IEEE MagNet Challenge Webinar - May 23 2025**
* **Thomas Guillod - Dartmouth College**

This webinar focuses on **ordinary differential equation models for soft-magnetic materials**:
* Using **equation-based models** (linear and nonlinear circuits)
* Using **neural ordinary differential equation** models

The **Python code** has the following features:
* Training and inference of ODE models
* Management of the dataset with dataframes
* Various metrics and plotting capabilities
* Using JAX for computations (does not require a GPU)
* Using Diffrax for solving the ODEs (with adjoints)

Various **optimizers** can be used to **train** the models:
* Scipy / latin hypercube sampler
* Scipy / differential evolution
* JAX / Optimistix / minimize solver
* JAX / Optimistix / least-square
* JAX / Optax / gradient descent
